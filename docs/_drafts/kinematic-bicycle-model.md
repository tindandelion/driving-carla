Now that we are equipped with the knowledge, it's time to get to the derivation of .... That will require a bit of geometry and basic trigonometry, but nothing over the top. 

## Model assumptions

Since modeling a car's behavior is a task that get very complicated very fast, a couple simplifications need to be made. First is a *kinematic assumption*. This restriction demands that the wheels of a car only move in their rolling direction, in other words the *tyre side slip* does not occur. This is a reasonable condition at low velocities. Under this no-slip condition the velocity vector matches precisely the wheel orientation.

The second is a simplification of a four-wheel model. The two rear wheels and the two front wheels are lumped together into a pair of imaginary rear and front wheel, essentially turning a car into a bicycle. The advantage of this model is that we need to deal with only one steering angle for the front wheel. However, such model will behave exactly as a four-wheel model, as long as the kinematic assumption holds. 

## Equations of motion

Let's now get to deriving the equations for the bicycle model. Consider our imaginary bicycle in motion:

The front wheel has a steering angle $$\delta$$, which makes the bicycle turn around the instantaneous center of rotation *O* with some angular velocity $$\omega$$. As we discussed in the [previous post][more-angular-velocity], the velocity vectors of the front and rear wheel will be orthogonal to lines $$OW_f$$ and $$OW_r$$, respectively.

We choose a reference point *C* on the bicycle frame. That point divides the whole vehicle length into front and rear parts, $$l_f$$ and $$l_r$$ respectively. These dimensions will be important later. 

Notice also that the overall direction in which the point *C* is moving is slightly sideways with respect to the vehicle heading $$\psi$$, with a slip angle $$\beta$$. Still, its linear velocity vector is orthogonal to line *OC*. 

By analogy with the [unicycle model][unicycle-model], and with the knowledge about [angular velocity][angular-velocity] we can derive base equations for point *C* motion: 

$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{x} = v \cos(\psi + \beta) \\
\dot{y} = v \sin(\psi + \beta) \\
\dot{\psi} = \omega = \frac v R \\
\end{cases}
$$

There are 2 unknowns in the system above: the rotation radius $$R$$ and the slip angle $$\beta$$. We'll need to use a bit of geometry to derive them from already known values. 

To find $$\beta$$, let's look closely at 2 triangles from the picture above, the big $$OW_rF$$ and the small $$OW_rC$$. First, we can show that angle at vertex *O*, $$\angle W_rOW_f = \delta$$. Indeed, if we consider the angle at the vertex $$W_f$$, we can see from the picture that : $$\angle W_rW_fO= \frac \pi 2 - \delta$$. Since the angle at vertex $$W_r$$ is orthogonal, we derive that $$\angle W_rOW_f = \pi - \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} + \delta \right) = \delta$$.

With the similar reasoning for the small triangle $$W_rOC$$ we can show that the angle at vertex O: $$\angle W_rOC = \beta$$.

Using these triangles, let's find $$\beta$$. Since both are right triangles that share the side $$OW_r= R_1$$, we can derive that: 

$$
\begin{align}
   & \tan \beta = \frac{l_r}{R_1} \\
   & \tan \delta = \frac{l_f + l_r}{R_1} \implies \frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{\tan \delta}{l_f + l_r} \\
\end{align}
\implies
