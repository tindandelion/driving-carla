This is a blog dedicated to my learning project I called "Driving Carla". 

In January, I started a [Self-Driving Cars Specialization][coursera-link] on Coursera and have been slowly progressing with the first introductory course. The course culminates in a software project, where you need to write a controller for a self-driving car to navigate it along a given track. This project uses a self-driving car simulator called [CARLA][carla], therefore the name of this project.
